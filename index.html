            <p>Bangladesh has been hit with the worst flooding in 100 years. Thousands of children are at risk,
                threatened by a high risk of drowning, disease, and malnutrition. More than 36,000 children are crowded
                into emergency flood shelters. Families and children are trapped at home waiting for boats to bring
                relief. Roads and homes have been submerged, power stations are down, and over 380 schools have been
                closed or impacted. </p>

            <h2>Our Donation Plan</h2>
            <p>The extreme flooding has caused heartbreaking damage across north-eastern Bangladesh putting 1.6 million
                children at risk. UNICEF is working with government and local partners to provide emergency supplies and
                services to those affected by floods. Children are in need, crowded in shelters for multiple days and
                facing a high risk of drowning. Over 90% of the health facilities in the region have been inundated,
                leaving childrens without health care, while cases of waterborne diseases continue to rise. Your
                donation will help support children in Bangladesh during this emergency, to help them survive, and to
                help rebuild after the floods. They need help now. </p>
